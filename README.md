# Simple E-commerce Website
This is just a practice project to understand the concepts of Angular more and achieve more hands on practice.

The simple services that this website has are:  
- Products and their information are fetched from an API and displayed in cards.  
- You can view the product prices, the product name, and whether it is in stock or not.  
- There is a button to "Add to Cart" for every product in the card.  
- On the top right corner of the page, there is a Cart button with the updated number of items that you have selected.  
- The Cart button routes you to the cart summary page, which displays the buy summary.  
- The total of the cart updates upon updating the items in the cart.  

### Angular concepts used:  
- Components  
- Services and Dependency Injection  
- API calls using fetch  
- Creating a Product Model - interfaces  

### Further development that could be made on this website for a more real-world application:  
- Usage of a component library  
- Loaders, notifications  
- Server-side integration + payments  
- Forms for consumer info  
- Other features, such as preventing adding an out-of-stock item to the cart
