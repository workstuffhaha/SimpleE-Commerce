# Simple E-commerce Website
This is just a practice project to understand the concepts of Angular more and achieve more hands on practice.

The simple services that this Website has is : 
    - Products and their information is fetched from an API and displayed in cards 
    - You can view the product prices, the product name, and if its in stock or not
    - There is a button to "Add to Cart" for every product in the card.
    - On the top right corner of the page, there is a Cart button with the updated number of items that you have selected.
    - The Cart button routes you to the cart summary page, which displays the buy summary.
    - The total of the cart updates on updation of the items in the cart.

Angular concepts used : 
    - Components
    - Services and Dependency Injection 
    - API calls using fetch
    - Creating a Product Model - interfaces 

Further development that could be made on this website for a more real world application : 
    - Usage of a component library
    - Loaders, Notifications
    - Server Side Integration + Payments
    - Forms for consumer info
    - Other features like if an item is out of stock you shouldnt be able to add it
